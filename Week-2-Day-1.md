# Week 2 â€“ Day 1: Git & GitHub Basics for DevOps

## âœ… 1. What is Git (in CI/CD Context)?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.  
In CI/CD, Git plays a critical role in:
- Triggering pipelines automatically when code is pushed.
- Managing features and environments via branches.
- Maintaining a history of changes and enabling rollbacks.
- Supporting team collaboration.

---

## âœ… 2. Git Branching (Why it Matters in DevOps?)
- Branching allows development in isolation.
- Enables testing features without affecting the main application.
- Feature branches are merged into `main` after review and testing.
- Merges into `main` can trigger automated pipelines (CI/CD).

---

## âœ… 3. Merging & Merge Conflicts
- **Merging** is combining one branch into another.
- Merge conflicts occur when the same file or lines are modified in two branches.
- Resolving conflicts manually is part of collaboration and version control.

---

## âœ… 4. GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) â€“ Team Collaboration
- A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- PRs allow:
  - Code reviews.
  - Discussions.
  - Triggering CI/CD pipelines.
  - Safe and trackable merges.

## âœ… 5. Git CLI Commands (Used in CI/CD Automation)

| Step | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Clone Repo | `git clone <repo-url>` | Clone remote repo to local |
| Create Branch | `git checkout -b feature-branch` | Create and switch to new branch |
| Edit File | `echo "text" >> file.txt` | Create/edit file |
| Stage Changes | `git add .` or `git add <file>` | Stage file(s) for commit |
| Commit Changes | `git commit -m "message"` | Save changes to local repo |
| Push Branch | `git push origin feature-branch` | Push branch to GitHub |
| Create PR | GitHub UI | Open Pull Request |
| Merge PR | GitHub UI | Merge into `main` |
